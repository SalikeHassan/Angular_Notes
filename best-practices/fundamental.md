# Angular Core Building Blocks

When designing Angular applications, there are key building blocks to understand:

- **Modules**: Encapsulate related components, services, and logic.
- **Components**: Represent the view layer of your application.
- **Services**: Encapsulate business logic and data access.

## Modules in Angular

### Definition & Purpose

- A **module** is a way to group related components, services, and other modules.
- Modules are the backbone of Angular applications, organizing code into logical units.

### Benefits of Using Modules

- **Encapsulation**: Helps isolate features and domains.
- **Scalability**: Useful for managing large, complex applications.
- **Reusability**: Feature modules can be shared across multiple parts of an app.

### Types of Modules

| Module Type        | Description                                                                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Root Module**    | The parent module responsible for bootstrapping the application.                                 |
| **Feature Module** | Groups components and services related to a specific feature (e.g., billing, inventory).         |
| **Shared Module**  | Contains reusable code (pipes, components, directives) to avoid duplication across the app.      |
| **Core Module**    | Provides singleton services (e.g., authentication) that should only be instantiated once.        |

## Best Practices for Modules

- **Use Feature Modules** for separating different functionalities.
- **Utilize a Core Module** for application-wide singleton services.
- **Use Shared Modules** to store reusable components, pipes, and directives.

## Standalone Components

### What Are Standalone Components?

- A **standalone component** is a self-contained Angular component that does not require a module to function.
- It simplifies the structure by directly specifying dependencies in the `@Component` decorator.

### Advantages of Standalone Components

- **Simplicity**: Reduces the need for module abstraction, especially in smaller projects.
- **Flexibility**: Ideal for simpler, React-style Angular applications.
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: No need to define a module to use components.

### When to Use Standalone Components vs Modules | Use Cases and Recommended Approaches

| Use Case                           | Recommended Approach                          |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Small, simpler applications**    | Standalone components                         |
| **Large, page-driven applications**| Modules (to encapsulate dependencies)         |

## Services in Angular

### Purpose of Services

- **Encapsulate business logic**, shared functions, and data access.
- Ensure **separation of concerns** by keeping logic out of components.

### Best Practices for Services

- **Singleton Services**: Use for services that need to persist data throughout the application, such as authentication services.
- **Encapsulation**: Keep your business logic isolated in services to maintain clean, readable components.

### Comparison: Modules vs Standalone Components

| Criteria             | Modules                              | Standalone Components                     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Project Size**     | Medium to large applications         | Small to medium applications              |
| **Ease of Maintenance** | Good for encapsulating features   | Best for simple, flat structures          |
| **Abstraction Level**| Higher (more configuration)          | Lower (direct, simpler approach)          |
| **Scalability**      | Preferred for scaling                | Limited scalability                       |

### Choosing the Right Approach

- **For complex, feature-rich applications**: Use **modules** to help organize the codebase and manage dependencies.
- **For lightweight, straightforward applications**: Use **standalone components** for a more streamlined and efficient approach.

## Key Takeaways

- **Aim for simplicity** in your Angular architecture to enhance maintainability.
- Use **modules** to encapsulate, scale, and reuse code efficiently.
- Leverage **standalone components** for simpler projects to reduce overhead.
- **Separate business logic** using services to maintain clean and testable components.

## Actionable Tips

- **Start with standalone components** for small projects. As the application grows, consider refactoring to feature modules.
- Always have a **core module** for singleton services and a **shared module** for reusable components.
- **Regularly refactor** and break down large components into smaller, reusable ones.
